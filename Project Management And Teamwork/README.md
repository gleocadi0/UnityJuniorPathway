# Overview

Project management and teamwork are often referred to as “soft skills” for design and development roles. Although project management can get technical, and there are several different project management methodologies you might encounter, it primarily takes teamwork — including communication and organization skills — to be a good project manager. 

Effective project management and teamwork involves:

- Clear communication with teammates, clients, and other stakeholders
- Delivery of a final product to deadline
- A final product or output that satisfies the requirements established for the project and meets the defined goal(s)

# Phases of production

- Pre-production: The work done before full-scale production begins, such as planning, prototyping, pipeline setup, and initial designs.

- Production: Creation of the product and assets within it, including the creation of final 2D images and 3D models, audio, lighting, and user experience.

- Post-production: Work done after the final product appears to be complete, including quality assurance (QA), editing, testing, bug fixing, and final polishing.

- Operations: Ongoing work after a product has been released to keep it running, such as sales, monetization, updates, and continued maintenance.

(Properly planning for each phase of the production cycle is crucial when you need to deliver a project that is on time and works as expected.)

# Overview

Project management and teamwork are often referred to as “soft skills” for design and development roles. Although project management can get technical, and there are several different project management methodologies you might encounter, it primarily takes teamwork — including communication and organization skills — to be a good project manager. 

Effective project management and teamwork involves:

- Clear communication with teammates, clients, and other stakeholders
- Delivery of a final product to deadline
- A final product or output that satisfies the requirements established for the project and meets the defined goal(s)

# Experience design and the real-time production cycle

Design primarily sits in the blended first three phases of the real-time production cycle:  pre-production, production and post-production. However, design has significant impact throughout the whole cycle. For example, findings during the operations cycle phase may result in ongoing design work for continuous improvement.
Many professional projects involve large teams that include product managers, designers, developers, and testing specialists from different disciplines. Even if “Designer” is not part of your official role, it’s still valuable for you to have  a clear understanding of the design process.

# The design process: ideation and research

The core process of designing a digital experience is similar to designing all sorts of other things. Let’s review that process with a focus on real-time 3D experience creation, starting with ideation and research: 

- Stage 1: Identify a problem or define an idea

Design for real-time 3D normally starts with a high-level problem statement or idea. This idea might be goal-focused; for example, “I want to make it easier for my architect client to visualize their design in 3D, which is not well-addressed by the solutions they’re currently trying.” Or, it might be a very high-level idea; for example, “We want to create a multiplayer tactical RPG.” 

Whatever the case, this initial statement should be the basis of the Game Design Document for the project. This can take many different forms, and acts as the single source of truth to guide design and development. 

- Stage 2: User and market research

The next stage is to take some time to research the target users and what’s currently available to meet their needs. All design activities start with consideration of the target users’ needs; the design and development process is a realization of one particular way to meet those needs. 
It is important to do some competitive research, to find out if there are already other offerings available to address your problem or something similar. This may help you to:

- Identify relevant constraints that might inform the scope of the project, technological or otherwise.

- Develop a better understanding of the unique value proposition of your proposed project, compared to the other ones available.

At this stage, it is also important to consider *inclusive design*, which is a design methodology for considering the needs of those who are under-represented or marginalized in a particular space. This includes people with disabilities and those who come from historically excluded or under-represented cultures and backgrounds.

- Stage 3: Create user personas and define use cases

User research is codified into specific user *personas*. Personas are fictional profiles of archetypical target users, drawing on the insights identified in your user research. These personas clearly define user needs, and are used throughout the design process to keep the team focused on the users. Part of this work may also involve identifying different use cases, where the needs of the target personas will be different. 

# The design process: clarified brief and initial prototypes

- Stage 4: Refine the brief and clarify goals
This stage is the last preparatory stage before full design work begins. It’s an opportunity to refine the brief based on the identified user needs, and to clarify your goals with these in mind. This process will help you keep a tight focus for your design work.

- Stage 5: Preliminary designs
Next, preliminary designs are created to address the brief. This is an exploratory and iterative design phase, in which the team:
Creates example designs

Evaluates them with the wider team against the defined user needs and the game design document
Refines the designs or moves in a new direction, and then repeats the cycle

Depending on the experience and the team involved, design work might be split into multiple workstreams. For example, if a team was designing a new phone rather than a real-time experience, they might split into separate teams for the hardware and the operating experience that could work concurrently.

This design stage could include:

- Creating visual representations of the experience, from simple sketches to complex schematics
- Mapping out the user experience flow or branching logic using a physical or digital whiteboard
- Creating user interface (UI) wireframes
- Producing concept art and other visual design sketches


- Stage 6: Prototyping
Next, the designs are used to create one or more basic prototypes of the experience. Depending on the project and the design methodology used by the creator or team, this stage may overlap with the creation of the preliminary designs. 
As with the preliminary designs, the prototype(s) are evaluated against the defined user needs and game design requirements; this continues throughout the design and development process. At this stage, external user feedback may be sought from target users, or the feedback may remain internal.- 

# The design process: iterative design and development

Stage 7: Iterative design and development
When the prototype(s) are signed-off by the project decision-makers, an iterative cycle begins:
Design
Build
Test
Evaluate
Refine the design
This stage can be organized in a variety of different ways, depending on the project scope and chosen design methodology. Evaluation is ongoing throughout this stage, with regular testing to ensure that the experience addresses the defined user needs. 
In addition, the experience will usually undergo extensive internal and external testing and user feedback cycles before being ready for launch.

# Common real-time experience design and development approaches

The high-level process outlined in the previous steps will differ slightly in practice, depending on the requirements of the project and the team. These differences are described as a design and development approach. For example, a solo hobbyist developer is likely to approach the design and development process in a different way from a large AAA game development team. While these approaches differ, the underlying principles of the design and development process remain the same.

- Waterfall approach
The waterfall approach is commonly used in traditional software development; it’s less common for creating games, but is sometimes used in non-game real-time experience creation. In this approach, after pre-production is complete, design and development is completed in defined and discrete linear stages. When one stage is complete and signed-off, the next is begun, like a waterfall flowing downward. 
This approach to design and development makes it difficult to change things once they are created, due to the dependencies between the different stages. Because of this limitation, the agile and hybrid approaches described below are usually preferred. 

- Agile approaches
Agile design and development, on the other hand, is an iterative approach. It involves working in cross-functional teams on particular features to incrementally plan, build, and refine the experience.  
This is a much more flexible methodology, providing design and development teams with greater flexibility and enabling them to adapt to new discoveries and changing requirements. This approach is often considered to favor agility (as the name suggests) over precision, though this is not the full story: it all depends on how the team implements the approach and what their defined 

- Hybrid approaches
A hybrid approach, using elements of both agile and waterfall, might involve having relatively linear preparation during project pre-production, but then iteratively building and testing in cycles focused on particular features.

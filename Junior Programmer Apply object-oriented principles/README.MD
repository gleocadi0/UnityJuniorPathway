The first pillar of OOP is all about keeping your code clean and simple for the programmer using it, whether that is you or someone else. Abstraction is the process of removing complex code from the scripts where other programmers will see it, and only exposing the functionality other programmers really need. When you “abstract out” the details, you reduce duplicate code and provide easy access to the most useful functions.

Abstraction simplifies your code and keeps it clean, making it easier for programmers to use. The core tenet of abstraction is to hide unnecessary complexity from the other programmers, and only expose what is needed to make the code run as it’s meant to. It means taking the complex inner workings and replacing them with abstract, more reusable pieces of code.  Following this principle also simplifies the process of refactoring later.

# What is inheritance?

Inheritance is the process of creating a primary class (also known as a parent class) from which other classes (called child classes) can be created. A child class takes on, or inherits, all of the features of the parent class automatically. It’s common to have different classes share similar features in an application. For example, a video game may feature many different types of enemy classes, but they are likely to share the same core features, such as managing their own health and the ability to deal damage to the player. With inheritance, the need to write that health and damage functionality for each individual enemy class is eliminated, so that you can focus on writing functionality that’s unique to each class.
